GraphQL API

In this project, I will create an application using a query language, designed to make APIs fast, flexible and developer-friendly. In the first part, I’ll create the back-end part using ExpressJs and set up GraphQl with all the parts (schema, root query and resolve function). In second part, I’ll connect the back-end to mongoDB and test my queries to GraphQL server using Graphiql. In the last part, I’ll create the front-end part using ReactJS and the GraphQL Client Apollo.
